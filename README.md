# CommunicationSurprise_DataCode

Welcome to the CommunicationSurprise_DataCode repository. This repository is dedicated to storing the data and code that support the analyses and figures featured in our recent manuscript on Communication with Surprise - Computatioinal and Cognitive Mechanisms of Non-verbal Human Interactions. Each folder contains specific parts of the work, as outlined below.

## Repository Contents

- `Comparative Evaluation of Model Performances/` - Contains scripts and data for evaluating the performance of different models as discussed in the manuscript.

- `Model-based PDR Analysis/` - Here, you'll find the code and datasets used for Pupillary Dilation Response (PDR) analysis based on our models.

- `Model-based EEG Analysis/` - This folder houses the scripts and datasets for Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis performed using our computational models.

- `Participants-generated and Model-simulated .../` - This directory encompasses the datasets generated by the participants in the study, alongside the datasets simulated by our computational models. Additionally, it includes scripts for visualizing the messages communicated during the study, providing a visual representation of the communication patterns and any surprising elements observed.

- `manuscript figures/` - Includes high-resolution versions of the figures that are incorporated into the manuscript.


## How to Use This Repository

To use the scripts and data provided:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder of interest.
3. Detailed instructions are provided within a folder, refer to the specific README within that directory for guidance.

## Software Requirements

The majority of scripts are designed to run on MATLAB. It is advisable to ensure you have a compatible version of MATLAB installed. Model-based PDR analysis and Bayesian factor analyssi require R.
